# Bank-telemarketing-success-prediction
In this project i have done data processing,data visualization ,data analysis to get insight and inferences
from the data set.The job was to predict the categorical output as YES or NO based on provided parameters of 
dataset and i used different machine learning models like Linear regression, K-nearest neighbor, Random forest 
and found that Random forest approach proved to be the best among all.
